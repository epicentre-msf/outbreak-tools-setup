Outbreak Tools is a set of solutions designed to provide a rapid response to epidemics. It comprises several packages, divided as follows:

-   Data capture and analysis in the field
-   Data cleaning and management
-   Visualization

In this document, we will concentrate on the data capture and analysis in the field section. The aim of this solution is to quickly create linelists including basic analyses for use in the field, without the need for advanced Excel skills or ad-hoc development. This solution is based on three Excel files:

-   The **set-up file**: exclusively used to define linelist specifications (in other terms, a glorified dictionary).
-   The **designer file**: it reads the set-up file and translates it into a new linelist file.
-   The **linelist file**: this is the file generated by the designer, containing all the characteristics described in the set-up file. It is made available to the field for data entry and an initial level of data analysis.

# Set-up file

The **set-up file** is a sort of advanced dictionary, describes the various tabs of the linelist to be created, in a predefined and standardised format.

The linelists created from this **set-up file** will contain several sheets: - Linelist sheet(s) for data entry - Analysis and graph sheets - Sheets for custom drop-down menus and the geographic base

The **set-up file** itself contains several sheets/tabs for defining the linelist and analyses, and for managing languages:

| Set-up sheet | Description                                                                                                                                                                                   | Correspondence in linelist file                                   |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dictionary   | Describes in full all the variables to be collected, the expected format, etc.                                                                                                                | Data entry sheets (typically, *Info sheet* and *Linelist* sheets) |
| Choices      | Defines the categories/levels accepted for certain variables, in the form of a list                                                                                                           | Drop-down menus in linelist sheets                                |
| Exports      | Defines the characteristics of exports, such as protection, choice of sheets to export and export names.                                                                                      | Export button in the Outbreak Tools ribbon                        |
| Analysis     | Describes the expected analyses in tabular form, by selecting the variables and indicating the formulas to be applied.                                                                        | Analysis sheets                                                   |
| Translation  | Automatically displays the list of strings of text/fields to be translated and adds new columns where the user can provide translated text in a desired language (one column = one language). | Choice of linelist language when created (designer)               |

The **set-up file** has been created in English, its entire structure is in English, but it is possible to fill it in French or in any other language you wish. The language of the final **linelist file** will be chosen when it is generated by the **designer file**, according to the languages available in the translation tab.

::: callout-note
**Please note:** It is not possible to write outside tables, nor to change the structure of tables.
:::

::: callout-info
It is possible to copy and paste, but the dimensions of the initial table (copied) must match those of the target table (pasted).

# Setup option Ribbon

There is a special *Setup Options* ribbon that contains functionalities related to the set-up file. These functionalities will be described in the “OutbreakTools ribbon section”.

The **designer** and **linelist** file created also contain their own OutbreakTools ribbon section, look it up when you open them.

# Typical workflow

1.  **Create the data dictionary**: go back and forth, filling the *Dictionary* and *Choices* sheets, to define the data entry sheets of the linelist (at minima a metadata sheet and a main linelist sheet)
2.  **Define the exports**: define the number of exports you want and their metadata on the *Exports* sheet, and fill the dedicated Export columns in the *Dictionary* sheet
3.  **Define the analyses** in the *Analysis* sheet
4.  **Add new translations** if you wish to, in the *Translations* sheet Between any of these steps, you can check for errors (see the OutbreakTools ribbon section of this document)
5.  Generate the linelist thanks to the **designer file**. Test it.
6.  Repeat steps 1 to 5 until the linelist works as expected. The rest of this guide will walk you through the sheets, the tables in it and the ribbon buttons.
