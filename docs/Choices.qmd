This sheet is used to define the **drop-down menus categories** to be inserted in certain variables, or the possible values for "choice_formula" type variables. 

There is only one table on this sheet, where you can define as many lists as is needed for dropdown menus variables. In this table, a **list** is represented by several lines, one line for each value in the drop-down list. Different lists are written one below the other.

## List Name

This is a free text field used to define a drop-down list. Lines with the same *name* filled belong to the same list. This name is used in the *Dictionary* sheet to identify the drop-down list to be used for a given variable.

::: callout-note
With the exception of lists used for "choice_custom" type variables, it is recommended not to leave any blanks in the list name. Instead, replace them with "\_", for example.
:::


::: callout-tip
It is not mandatory, but we advise that you begin all your list names by "list_" to easily separate them from variable names in the dictionary.
:::


## Ordering list

This is a free text field. Fill in integers to define the order in which the options are displayed in the drop-down menu.


## Label

This is a free text field used to list the different values to be displayed in the drop-down menus.

::: callout-note
Categories names should not begin with a "\<" or a "\>".
