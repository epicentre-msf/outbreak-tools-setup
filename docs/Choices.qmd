This sheet is used to define the **drop-down menus** to be inserted in certain variables, or the possible values for "choice_formula" type variables. In this table, a **list** is represented by several lines, one line for each value in the drop-down list. Different lists are written one below the other.

## List Name

This is a free text field used to define a drop-down list. Lines with the same *name* filled belong to the same list. This name is used in the *Dictionary* sheet to identify the drop-down list to be used for a given variable.

::: callout-info
With the exception of lists used for "choice_custom" type variables, it is recommended not to leave any blanks in the list name. Instead, replace them with "\_", for example.

## Label
