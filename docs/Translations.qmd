To avoid having different setups for different languages, a *Translation* sheet is included. The fields in the various sheets that require translation are automatically identified by the "translate as text" tag located above the column to be translated.

The *Translation* sheet should contains at least one column, with the default language. i.e. the language you chose to complete the **set-up file** (here: "French").

The column headings can be modified. It is better to name the languages in the table headings, as they will be used to populate a drop-down menu later, when the linelist is created.

Simply click on "update translation set" to import all the fields to be translated into the table. They are listed in alphabetical order.

To add a language to the table, use the Setup Options menu in the Ribbon.

In the "Translation" block, in the "Add language" field, enter the name of the language you want to add, then press the "Enter" key on your keyboard.

The new language is added to the table:

You can then complete your translations.

If you are making changes to the set-up and want to ensure that all the translatable fields are correctly listed, click Update translation table. A message will then inform you of the number of missing fields per language.

::: callout-note
Please note that there is no control or intelligence behind the notions of default language and other languages, i.e. if you name the first column "French" and the second "English", even though you have used English in the **set-up file**, it is the column named first column named "French" that will contain the values in English.
:::

Similarly, if you have mixed several languages across the **set-up file**, all the values will be in the same column, the first column of the table.

::: callout-note
There should not be duplicates (two pieces of text in one language translated in the exact same text in another language), as these will prevent automatic translation during data compilation.

::: callout-note
Trailing white spaces can sometimes cause problem, remove them from the setup.
:::

::: callout-note
If, when the linelist is generated, certain fields of the chosen language are missing, these fields will appear in the default language (the first column). That being said, if a string of text contains special characters, this could cause a bug. In general, we advise to fill all cells in all languages.
