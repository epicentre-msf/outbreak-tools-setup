It is possible to predefine exports, such as a specific export for a given MoH. The setup of exports is done in two different places:

- In the export sheet you define the export: numbers of exports and their metadata (lutton label, exported file name, type of headers etc.)  

- In the *Dictionary* sheet you define which variable is exported in each export, and in which order  

::: callout-warning
Without some of export metadata, it may simply not be possible to generate an export, or it may contain only the variables selected, in raw format.
:::


A sheet in the **linelist file** corresponds to a sheet in the **exported file**.


## Export Number

The fields are pre-filled. One line corresponds to one export. The exports are numbered from 1 to how many exports are available.

In line "1", we define the parameters for export 1, whose variables to be exported have been defined in the *Dictionary* sheet in the "Export 1" column, etc.

Note that you can use the "*Add rows to table in current sheet*" button or the "*Resize tables in current sheet*" to add more export or removed empty rows, see the *Setup Options ribbon* section below.


## Status

This is an *active/inactive* drop-down menu field. It is used to activate or deactivate an export button.

Example:

Definition in the **setup file**:

![](imgs/im-091-status-exports-sheet.png)

Display in the **linelist file** :

## Label Button

This is a free text field that contains the label of the export button in the linelist. It should be fairly concise or it may overflow the button box.

Example :

Definition in the **setup file**:

Display in the **linelist file**:

![](imgs/im-094-label-button-exports-sheet.png)

## File Format

This is a dropdown menu that allows choosing between the **xlsx** and **xlsb** file format for the exported file.


## File Name

This is a free text field used to define the **name** of the export. 


While it is a free text field that could accept a chain of character to generate a **fixed** export name, it is possible to refer to the content of linelist *variables* to create a name **dynamically**, that is, a name that depends on the context the linelist is used.

Variables that can be called in this field are variables defined in a **vlist1D**, in other words, variables that contain only one value (usually used in the "Info" / "Metadata" sheet).

### Rules to create a name

-   *Character strings* passed to this field must be enclosed in inverted commas like these: *"a character string*"
-   *Variable names* passed to this field must be naked (not surrounded by inverted comas), similarly to how we refer to variables in the *Dictionary* sheet columns.
-   Different components of the name are separated by '*+*' in the setup, which will create names where the components are separated by '*\_\_*'.
-   No need to add a date to the export: the date and time at which an export is made is appended at the end of the name automatically.
-   If the export is to be password protected (see below), the public key for opening the file will be included in the name.

### Example

![](imgs/im-095-example-file-name.png)

Here, the pieces in green, surrounded by inverted comas are fixed bits of texts (character strings). The blue pieces are *vlist1D variables* that were defined in that linelist (in the Info sheet, hence their suffixes).

This name specification will result in the following export names, depending on where the linelist is used (hence depending on how they filled the metadata):

-   MNG_linelist\_\_MNG24\_\_SSD\_\_MSF-OCP\_\_Aweil\_\_anonyme\_\_vb-1003\_\_20240617-1901.xlsb if the linelist was used by OCP in Aweil (South Sudan)
-   MNG_linelist\_\_MNG24\_\_NER\_\_WaCa\_\_Maradi\_\_anonyme\_\_vb-2035\_\_20240617-1903.xlsb if the linelist was used by WaCa in Maradi (Niger)
-   ...

Note: if a variable is referred to in the name but remains empty in the linelist, the **name of the variable** is used as a placeholder. For example, if the data encoder filled none of the variables in the metadata, the created file would have the following name:

MNG_linelist\_\_info_outbreak_code\_\_info_country_code\_\_info_organisation\_\_info_facility_name\_\_anonyme\_\_vb-1003\_\_20240617-1906.xlsb

## Password

This is a yes/no drop-down field that is used to define whether or not the export should be password-protected.

If so, the password will be displayed automatically when the export is created.

Example:

Definition in the **set-up file**:

![](imgs/im-096-example-password.png)

Display in the **linelist file**:

![](imgs/im-097-example-password.png)

![](imgs/im-098-example-password.png)

## Include personal identifiers

This is a *yes/no* dropdown menu that defaults to "*no*" and that controls whether *variables* that are tagged as "*Personal identifier*" in the *Dictionary* sheet should be included in the export.

## Include P-code

This is a *yes/no* drop-down field. By selecting *'yes'*, you decide that in addition to columns included in this export, you want to export (usually) hidden columns containing processed geographic data such as P-codes. These columns can be used for mapping (locally or in dashboards).

## Header format

This is a *variables names/variables labels* drop-down menu field. It allows you to define whether you want the column headings in the export to correspond to the *variable names* or their *labels*.

::: callout-info
If you create an export for analyses purpose, use the *variable names* to avoid having to rename when importing in your favourite statistical software. If you are exporting data to the MoH or other partners, it might be easier for them to have the full labels, which are more descriptive.

## Export Metadata Sheets

This is a *yes/no* drop-down field. By selecting "yes", you decide that in addition to the data to be exported, you will also export:

-   The "*Dictionary*" sheet
-   The "*Choices*" sheet
-   A metadata sheet

## Export Translation

This is a *yes/no* drop-down field. Selecting "yes" means that, in addition to the data to be exported, we will also have the sheet containing the translations (see Translation section below).

## Export Analysis Sheet

This is a *yes/no* drop-down field. By selecting 'yes', you decide that in addition to the data to be exported, you will also export all the analysis tables (but not the graphs).

Note: it is also possible to export analysis tables directly from the linelist using the "Export analyses" button.
