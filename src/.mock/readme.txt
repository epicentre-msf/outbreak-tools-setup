Classes and modules for the mock setup, to initialize some elements.
Use in case your setup is completely broken and needs to be
recreated from a fresh new one.

Please Remember to hit on initialize button in "Dev" sheet before using
the current setup for development (to create dropdowns, etc.)

This a mock of the setup, you should keep in mind you will need to import
the codes for setup management after initializing this one.
